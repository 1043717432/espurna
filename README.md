# ESPurna

ESPurna ("spark" in Catalan) is a custom C firmware for ESP8266 based smart switches.
It was originally developed with the **[ITead Sonoff][1]** in mind but now it supports a growing number of ESP8266-based boards.

## Features

* **Asynchronous WebServer for configuration** and simple relay toggle with **basic authentication**
* Communication between webserver and webclient via **websockets** with secure ticket check
* **Flashing firmware Over-The-Air** (OTA)
* Up to **3 configurable WIFI networks**, connects to the strongest signal
* **MQTT support** with configurable host and topic
* **REST API** to query and set relay statuses
* Support for **multi-relay boards** (Sonoff Dual, Electrodragon ESP Relay Board,...)
* Manual switch ON/OFF with button (single click the button)
* AP mode backup (double click the button)
* Manual reset the board (long click the button)
* Visual status of the connection via the LED
* **Alexa** integration (Amazon Echo or Dot) by emulating a Belkin WeMo switch
* Support for **automatic over-the-air updates** through the [NoFUSS Library][2]
* Support for **DHT22** and **DS18B20** sensors
* Support for the **HLW8012** power sensor present in the Sonoff POW
* Support for **current monitoring** through the [EmonLiteESP Library][3] using a non-intrusive current sensor ([requires some hacking][4])
* Command line configuration
