# ESPurna Firmware

ESPurna ("spark" in Catalan) is a custom firmware for ESP8266 based smart switches.
It was originally developed with the **[IteadStudio Sonoff][1]** in mind but now it supports a growing number of ESP8266-based boards.
It uses the Arduino Core for ESP8266 framework and a number of 3rd party libraries.

**Current Release Version is 1.2.0**, read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

* Support for **multiple ESP8266-based boards** ([check list](#supported-hardware))
* Wifi **AP Mode** or **STA mode** with **multiple network definitions**
* **MQTT** enabled
    * Switch on/off and toggle relays
    * LED notifications
* Support for different **sensors**
    * DHT11 / DHT22 / DHT21 / AM2301
    * DS18B20
    * HLW8012 (Sonoff POW)
    * Non-invasive current sensor using the [EmonLiteESP Library][3] (requires some hacking)
* Fast asynchronous **HTTP Server**
    * Basic authentication
    * Web-based configuration
    * Relay switching from the web
    * Websockets-based communication between the device and the browser
* **REST API**
    * GET and PUT relay status
* **Command line configuration**
* **Over-The-Air** (OTA) updates even for 1Mb boards
    * Manually from PlatformIO or Arduino Inside
    * Automatic updates through the [NoFUSS Library][2]
* **Alexa** integration (requires staging version of Arduino Core for ESP8266)
